    <h1>My beautiful website!</h1>
    <p>This website is actually beautiful, and I dont really care what you think of it, because it did not make me time and
        it pleases my eyes.</p>
    <p>I built this website using my beautiful cascading style sheets that I created, and no one ever can copy them, because
        they are protected by law. :)</p>
