        <h1>My beautiful website!</h1>
        <p>This website is actually beautiful, and I dont really care what you think of it, because it did not make me time and it pleases my eyes.</p>
        <p>I built this website using my beautiful cascading style sheets that I created, and no one ever can copy them, because they are protected by law. :)</p>
